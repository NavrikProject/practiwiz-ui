              <h4>Tarun Gautam</h4>
              <h2>Our Visionary Founder</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Practiwiz is the brainchild of Tarun Gautam, a graduate from
                  Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Lucknow.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                After a successful career of 20 years that gave him a rich
                experience of working with leading global brands and travelling
                to over 22 countries, Tarun decided to found Practiwiz as a part
                of Navrik Software Solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Navrik was born with the philosophy that is derived from two
                words of it’s name- Navomesh that means innovation in Sanskrit
                and Maverick that refers to passionate free thinkers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the Navrik journey, we realized that we could cover the
                gap of practical training by imparting our practical project
                training to students and professionals.
                <br />
                Tarun also believed that the practical training should be in a
                fun & stress-free way so that the concepts are easily digested.
                <br />
                Since Navrik’s areas of expertise are RPA, AI and ML the idea
                has been to develop in-house content that can benefit students
                and professionals.
              </p>
              <p>
                He left his Corporate Career behind to build up his own
                successful start-up Navrik Software Solutions which is the
                backbone of Practiwiz – and unique e-learning platform for the
                career oriented with a twist of fun with learning.
